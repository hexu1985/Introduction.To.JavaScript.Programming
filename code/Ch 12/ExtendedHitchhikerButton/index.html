      Before exploring the interactions between JavaScript and the web
      environment in more detail, it is useful to set the stage by looking
      at a simple web page that uses buttons to trigger interactions just
      as most modern applications do.  My favorite example comes from the
      following scene in Douglas Adams&rsquo;s 1979 novel, <i>The
      Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy,</i> in which Arthur Dent
      and Ford Prefect find themselves aboard a marvelous new spaceship:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the
      vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind wander,
      trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer
      bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a
      nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words &ldquo;Please do not
      press this button again.&rdquo;
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is easy to simulate this vignette in a web page.  The first step
      is to create a button in the window, which for the moment can be
      labeled with its color, like this:
    </p>
    <button type="button"
            onclick="console.log('Please do not press this button again.')">
      RED
    </button>
  </body>
