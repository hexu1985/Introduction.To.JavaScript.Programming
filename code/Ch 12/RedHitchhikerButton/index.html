      Before exploring the interactions between JavaScript and the
      web environment in more detail, it is useful to set the stage
      by looking at a simple web page that uses buttons to trigger
      interactions just as most modern applications do.  My
      favorite illustration of this interaction model comes from
      the following scene in Douglas Adams&rsquo;s 1979 novel,
      <i>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy,</i> in which
      Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect find themselves aboard a
      marvelous new spaceship:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to
      understand the vast majority of what Ford was saying he
      began to let his mind wander, trailing his fingers along
      the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached
      out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby
      panel. The panel lit up with the words &ldquo;Please do
      not press this button again.&rdquo;
    </blockquote>

      It is easy to simulate this vignette in a web page.
      The first step is to create a button in the window, which
      for the moment can be labeled with its color, like this:
    </p>
    <button type="button"
            onclick="console.log('Please do not press this button again.')">
      RED
    </button>
  </body>
