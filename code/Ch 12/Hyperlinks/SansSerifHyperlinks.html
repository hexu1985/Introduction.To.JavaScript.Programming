      One of the fundamental advantages of the web is that pages
      can include references to other pages that provide additional
      information.  These references to other pages are called
      <b><i>hyperlinks.</i></b>

      As with Otlet&rsquo;s vision of a universal web of documentation,
      the idea of linking documents together has a long history.
      A surprisingly modern conception of the web appears in a 1945
      article in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> entitled
      &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think">As We
      May Think</a>&rdquo; written by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>,
      who headed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development
      during World War II.  The pioneering information technologist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>
      coined the term <i>hyperlink</i> in 1963.
